== Case Class
Case Classes are one of the most useful nifty little compiler tricks available in Scala.
While not being very complicated, they help a lot with otherwise very tedious and boring things such as `equals`, `hashCode` and `toString` implementations, and also preparing `apply` / `unapply` methods in order to be used with pattern matching, and more.

A case class is defined just like a normal class in Scala, but prepended with the `case` keyword:

```scala
case class Circle(radius: Double)
```

Just by this one line, we have already implemented the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_object[Value Object] pattern.
This means that by defining a case class we automatically get these benefits:

* instances of it are immutable,
* can be compared using `equals`, and equality is defined by it's fields (NOT object identity like it would be the case with a normal class),
* it's `hashcode` adheres the `equals` contract, and is based on the values of the class,
* the `radius` constructor parameter is a `public val`
* it's `toString` is composed of the class name and values of the fields it contains (for our Circle it would be implemented as `def toString = s"Circle($radius)"`).

Let's see what we got so far, and expand on this using a "real life" example, this time implementing a `Point` class, because we'll beed more than just one field to show off some interesting features `case class` provides us with:

```scala
case class Point(x: Int, y: Int)      <1>
val a = Point(0, 0)                   <2>
// a.toString == "Point(0,0)"         <3>

val b = a.copy(y = 10)                <4>
// b.toString == "Point(0,10)"

a == Point(0, 0)                      <5>
```
<1> `x` and `y` are automatically defined as `val` members
<2> a `Point` companion object is generated for it, with an `apply(x: Int, y: Int)` method which we can use to create instances using this syntax
<3> the generated `toString` method consists of the classname and case class parameter values
<4> the `copy(...)` method allows to easily create derrative objects, by changing only selected fields
<5> equality of case classes is value based (`equals` and `hashCode` implementations based on the case class parameters are generated)

Not only that, but a case class is ready to be used with _pattern matching_, using either the "usual" or "extractor" syntax:

``` scala
Circle(2.5) match {
  case Circle(r) => println("Radius = " + r)
}

val Circle(r)
val r2 = r + r
```
