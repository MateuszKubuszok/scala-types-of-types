== Existential Types

Existential Types are something that deeply relates to Type Erasure, which JVM languages "have to live with".

```scala
val thingy: Any = ???

thingy match {
  case l: List[a] =>
     // lower case 'a', matches all types... what type is 'a'?!
}
```

We don't know the type of `a`, because of runtime type erasure. We know though that List is a type constructor, `* -> *`, so there must have been some type
it would have used to construct a valid `List[T]`. This "some type", is the **existential type**!

Scala provides a shortcut for it:

```scala
List[_]
 //  ^ some type, no idea which one!
```

Let's say you're working with some Abstract Type Member, that in our case will be some Monad.
We want to force users of our class into using only `Cool` instances within this Monad, because for example,
only for these Types our Monad has any meaning. We can do this via Type Bounds on these *Existential Type T*:

```scala
type Monad[T] forSome { type T >: Cool }
```
