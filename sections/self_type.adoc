== Self Type Annotation

**Self Types** are used in order to "require" that, if another class uses this trait,
it should also provide implementation of whatever it is that you're requiring.

Let's look at an example where a service requires some Module which provides other services.
We can state this using the following Self Type Annotation:

```scala
trait Module {
  lazy val serviceInModule = new ServiceInModule
}

trait Service {
  this: Module =>

  def doTheThings() = serviceInModule.doTheThings()
}
```

The second line can be read as "I'm a Module". It might seem yield the exactly same But how does this differ from extending `Module` right away?

which means that someone will have to give us this Module at instantiation time:

```scala
trait TestingModule extends Module { /*...*/ }

new Service with TestingModule
```

If you were to try to instantiate it without mixing in the required trait it would fail like this:

```scala
new Service

// class Service cannot be instantiated because it does not conform to its self-type Service with Module
//              new Service
//              ^
```

You should also keep in mind that it's OK to specify more than one trait when using the self-type syntax.
And while we're at it, let's discuss why it is called self-type (except for the "yeah, it makes sense" factor). Turns out a popular style (and possibility) to write it looks like this:

```scala
class Service {
  self: MongoModule with APIModule =>

  def delegated = self.doTheThings()
}
```

In fact, you can use any identifier (not just `this` or `self`) and then refer to it from your class.
