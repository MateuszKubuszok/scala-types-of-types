== The Bottom Types - Nothing and Null

In Scala everything has "some" type... but have you ever wondered how the type inferencer can still work, and infer sound types when working with "weird" situations like throwing exceptions? Let's investigate the below "if/else throw" example:

```scala
val thing: Int =
  if (test)
    42                             // : Int
  else
    throw new Exception("Whoops!") // : Nothing
```

As you can see in the comments, the type of the if block is `Int` (easy), the type of the else block is `Nothing` (interesting). The inferencer was able to infer that the `thing` value, will only ever be of type `Int`. This is because of the **Bottom Type** property of Nothing.

NOTE:  A very nice intuition about how bottom types work is: _"`Nothing` extends everything."_

Type inference always looks for the "common type" of both branches in an if stamement, so if the other branch here is a Type that extends everything, the infered type will automatically be the Type from the first branch.

```scala
Types visualized:

           [Int] -> ... -> AnyVal -> Any
Nothing -> [Int] -> ... -> AnyVal -> Any
```

The same reasoning can be applied to the second Bottom Type in Scala - `Null`.

```scala
val thing: String =
  if (test)
    "Yay!"  // : String
  else
  	null    // : Null
```

The type of `thing` is as expected, String. `Null` follows ALMOST the same rules as Nothing. I'll use this case to take a small detour to talk about inference, and the differences between AnyVals and AnyRefs.

```
Types visualized:

        [String] -> AnyRef -> Any
Null -> [String] -> AnyRef -> Any

infered type: String
```

Let's think about `Int` and other primitives, which cannot hold null values. To investigate this case let's drop into the REPL and use the `:type` command (which allows to get the type of an expression):

```scala-repl
scala> :type if (false) 23 else null
Any
```

This is different than the case with a String object in one of the branches. Let's look into the types in detail here, as `Null` is a bit less "extends everything" than `Nothing`. Let's see what `Int` extends in detail, by using `:type` again on it:

```scala-repl
scala> :type -v 12
// Type signature
Int

// Internal Type structure
TypeRef(TypeSymbol(final abstract class Int extends AnyVal))
```

The verbose option adds a bit more information here, now we know that `Int` is an `AnyVal` - this is a special class representing value types - which cannot hold `Null`. If we look into https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/v2.10.3/src/library/scala/AnyVal.scala[AnyVal's sources], we'll find:

```scala
abstract class AnyVal extends Any with NotNull
```

I'm bringing this up here because the core functionality of AnyVal is so nicely represented using the Types here. *Notice the `NotNull` trait!*

Coming back to the subject why the common Type for our if statement with an `AnyVal` on one code block and a `null` on the other one was Any and not something else. The one sentence way to define it is: `Null extends all AnyRefs` whereas `Nothing extends anything`. As AnyVals (such as numbers), are not in the same tree as AnyRefs, the only common Type between a number and a `null` value is Any - which explains our case.

```scala
Types visualized:

Int  -> NotNull -> AnyVal -> [Any]
Null            -> AnyRef -> [Any]

inferred type: Any
```
