== Type Projection

Type Projections are similar to Path Dependent Types in the way that they allow you to refer to a type of an inner class. In terms of syntax, you path your way into the structure of inner classes splitting them with a `#` sign. Let's start out by showing the first and main difference between these path dependent types (the "." syntax) vs. type projections (the "#" syntax):

```scala
// our example class structure
class Outer {
  class Inner
}

// Type Projection (and alias) refering to Inner
type OuterInnerProjection = Outer#Inner

val out1 = new Outer
val out1in = new out1.Inner
```

Another nice intuition about path dependent vs. projections is that Type Projections can be used for "type level programming" ;-)
