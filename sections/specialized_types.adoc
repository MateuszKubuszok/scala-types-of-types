== Specialized Types 

=== @specialized

Type specialization is actualy more of an performance technique than plain "type system stuff", but nevertheless it's something very important and worth keeping in mind if you want to write well performing collections. For our example we'll be implementing a very useful collection called `Parcel[A]`, which can hold a value of a given type -- how useful indeed!

```scala
case class Parcel[A](value: A)
```

That's our basic implementation. What's the drawbacks here? Well, as `A` can be anything, it will be represented as an Java **object**, even if we'd only ever put `Int` into boxes. So the above class would cause us to box and unbox primitive values, because the container is working on objects:

```scala
val i: Int = Int.unbox(Parcel.apply(Int.box(1)))
```

As we all know - boxing when you don't really need to is not a good idea as it's generating more work for the runtime with "back and forth" converting the `int` to `object Int`. What could do to fix this problem? One of the tricks to apply here is to "**specialize**" our Parcel for all primitive types (let's say only `Long` and `Int` are good enough for now), like this:

NOTE: If you've already read about <<value-class, Value Classes>> you might have noticed that `Parcel` could be very nicely implemented using those instead! That is indeed true. However, `specialized` has been around in Scala since `2.8.1` and Value Classes were introduced recently in `2.10.x`. Also, *you can specialize on more than one value* (although it does *exponentially* (sic!) grow the generated code!), while with Value Classes you're constrained to one value.

```scala
case class Parcel[A](value: A) {
  def something: A = ???
}

// specialzation "by hand"
case class IntParcel(intValue: Int) {
  override def something: Int = /* works on low-level Int, no wrapping! */ ???
}

case class LongParcel(intValue: Long) {
  override def something: Long = /* works on low-level Long, no wrapping! */ ???
}
```

The implementations inside `IntParcel` and `LongParcel` will efficiently avoid boxing, as they work directly on the primitives, and need not reach into the object realm. Now we just have to manualy select which `*Parcel` we want to use, depending on our use-case.

That's all nice and good but... the code basically has just become far less maintanable, with `N` implementations, for each primitive that we want to support (which could be any of: `int`, `long`, `byte`, `char`, `short`, `float`, `double`, `boolean`, `void`, plus the `Object` case)! That's a lot of boilerplate to maintain.

Since we're now familiar with the idea of specialization, and that it's not really as nice to implement by hand, let's see how Scala helps us out here by introducing the `@specialized` annotation:

```scala
case class Parcel[@specialized A](value: A)
```

So we're applying the `@specialized` annotation to the type parameter `A`, thus instructing the compiler to generate all specialized variants of this class - that is: `ByteParcel`, `IntParcel`, `LongParcel`, `FloatParcel`, `DoubleParcel`, `BooleanParcel`, `CharParcel`, `ShortParcel`, `CharParcel` and even `VoidParcel` (not actual names of the implementors, but you get the idea). Applying the "right" version is also taken up by the compiler, so we can write our code without caring if a class is specialized or not, and the compiler will do it's best to use the specialized version (if available):

```scala
val pi = Parcel(1)     // will use `int` specialized methods
val pl = Parcel(1L)    // will use `long` specialized methods
val pb = Parcel(false) // will use `boolean` specialized methods
val po = Parcel("pi")  // will use `Object` methods
```

"_Great, so let's use it everywhere!_" -- is a common reaction when people find out about specialization, as it can speed-up low level operations multiple times with lowering memory usage at the same time! Sadly, *it comes at a high price*: the generated code quickly becomes huge when used with multiple parameters like this:

```scala
class Thing[A, B](@specialized a: A, @specialized b: B)
```

In the above example we're using the second style of applying specialization - right onto the parameters - the effect is still the same as if we'd specialize `A` and `B` directly. Please notice that the above code would generate `8 * 8 = 64` (_sic!_) implementations, as it has to take care of cases like "A is an `int`, and B is an `int`" as well as "A is a `boolean`, but B is a `long`" -- you can see where this is heading. In fact the number of generated classes is around `2 * 10^(nr_of_type_specializations)`, which easily reaches thousands of classes for already 3 type parameters!

There are ways to limit this exponential explosion, for example by limiting the specialization target types. Let's say our `Parcel` will be used mosltly with integers, and never with floating point numbers -- using this we can ask the compiler to only specialize for `Long` and `Int` like this:

```scala
case class Parcel[@specialized(Int, Long) A](value: A)
```

Let's also look into the bytecode a little bit this time, by using `:javap Parcel`:

```
// Parcel, specialized for Int and Long
public class Parcel extends java.lang.Object implements scala.Product,scala.Serializable{
    public java.lang.Object value(); // generic version, "catch all"
    public int value$mcI$sp();       // int specialized version
    public long value$mcJ$sp();}     // long specialized version

    public boolean specInstance$();  // method to check if we're a specialized class impl.
}
```

As you can see, the compiler has prepared additional specialized methods for us, such as `value$mcI$sp()` returning an `int` and the same style of method for `long`. One other method worth mentioning here is `specInstance$` which returns `true` if the used implementation is a specialized class.

If you're curious, currently these classes are specialized in Scala (list may be incomplete): Function0, Function1, Function2, Tuple1, Tuple2, Product1, Product2, AbstractFunction0, AbstractFunction1, AbstractFunction2. Due to how costy it is to specialize beyond 2 parameters, it's a trend to not specialize for more params, although certainly possible.

WARNING: A prime example why we want to avoid boxing is also memory efficiency. Imagine a `boolean`, it would be great if it would be stored as one bit, sadly it isn't (not on any JVM I know of), for example on HotSpot an `boolean` is represented as `int`, so it takes *4 bytes* of space. It's cousin `java.lang.Boolean` on the other hand has *8 bytes of object header*, as does any Java object, then it stores the `boolean` inside (another *4 bytes*), and due to the *Java Object Layout alignment rules*, the space taked up by this object will be aligned to *16 bytes* (8 for object header, 4 for the value, 4 bytes of padding). That's yet another reason why we want to avoid boxing so badly.

WARNING: This is not a Scala feature, but can be used with scalac as a _compiler plugin_.

We've explained in the previous section that specialization is quite powerful, yet at the same time it's a bit of a "compiler bomb", with it's exponential growth potential. Turns out there is already a working proof of concept that takes away this problem. Miniboxing is a compiler plugin achieving the same result as `@specialized` but without generating thousands of classes.
